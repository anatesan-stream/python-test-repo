Streamlinity Python Rest Controller Testing

You have a local JSON file ItemPrices.json.   It has several Item info in a JSON array.  Take a look at it.

Your assignment is to build a LOCAL Service and REST end points using this data using Python/DJango framework.

 * Required REST Endpoints
 *
 *      /item                       Get all items
 *      /item?category=C            Get all items in category specified by Category shortName
 *      /item/{itemShortName}       Get item that matches the specified Item shortName

 You need to demonstrate a working solution and show data being returned from your End points with your
 code running on your laptop.
 You can use whatever IDE you want.

 Please finish the REST end-points one at a time, so you can show incremental progress.

 Time limit is 45m.
